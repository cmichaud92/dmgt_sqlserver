# Schema development for `moab_db`

This project focuses on the development of a flexible database schema capable
of storing diverse data from a large number of disparate projects run through
the Moab Field Office (Utah Division of Wildlife Resources). The database will
be deployed on a network MS SQL Server platform which is enabled to serve
multiple connections.
